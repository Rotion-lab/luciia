# Changelog

## 1.2.0

### New

- Refresh the app with responsive rail and drawer navigation, canonical `/mail/*` routes, Inter
  typography, full-page conversation reading, and MCP and Agent Skill settings.
- Add opaque cursor pagination for message listings, with stable ordering and bounded pages.
- Add a durable `/api/v1/changes` feed with deletion tombstones and access-change records for
  reliable client synchronization.
- Make terminal installation and removal resumable with atomic resource checkpoints, live identity
  verification, preservation of reused resources, and fail-closed recovery for ambiguous state.
- Add forward, unarchive, and restore actions across the app, REST, and MCP, including optional
  forwarding of the original message's attachments.

### Fixed

- Fix catch-all messages being absent from conversations, REST, MCP, unread counts, push
  notifications, and the changes feed. Catch-all mail remains owner-only, and messages from a
  deleted mailbox do not become visible as catch-all mail.
- Return restored and unarchived messages to Inbox, Sent, or Catch-all according to their direction
  and assignment instead of moving every message to one folder.
- Reopen saved reply and forward drafts with their accessible conversation, preserve the exact
  target, keep the composer visible, and block sending when the target is missing or inaccessible.
- Correct send, reply, and forward authorization so valid mailbox sends work and source-message
  access is checked against the correct resource.
- Allow refresh-token retries during the configured rotation window without invalidating the token
  family.
- Preserve attachment media types through draft upload and forwarding, and document the attachment
  size limits in the public API contract.
- Block direct HTTP access to Better Auth admin endpoints so an admin cannot promote themselves to
  owner or replace an owner's password outside HQBase's owner-only controls.
- Show the requesting OAuth client's ID and homepage on the consent page, and clarify native PKCE
  registration so people can verify the client before approval.
- Prevent Reply from addressing the workspace sender, repair compact Settings navigation, and wait
  for mail actions to finish before showing success.
- Clarify that conversation action routes take the conversation's latest message ID, not its thread
  ID, in the Agent Skill, OpenAPI document, and Postman collection.

## 1.1.2

- Add secure self-service password recovery from the sign-in page. Recovery links expire after
  seven days, work once, invalidate older unused password links, and revoke existing sessions after
  a successful reset.
- Keep generated customer deployments on their configured hostname by disabling preview URLs.
- Post complete release notes to the configured Discord webhook only after the signed release and
  public archive pass verification. Discord delivery failures do not invalidate a release.
- Improve the repository README so installation, documentation, community, contribution, security,
  and local-development paths are easier to find.

## 1.1.1

- Publish the deployment-local Mail API instructions as a valid Agent Skill at
  `/skills/hqbase-mail/SKILL.md`, add Copy and Download Skill actions, and redirect the earlier
  `/AGENTS.md` and `/agents.md` paths.

## 1.1.0

- Add a stable, versioned Mail API for mailboxes, messages, conversations, attachments, drafts,
  sending, and replies. API clients can use audience-bound OAuth bearer tokens, while the web app
  uses the same `/api/v1` routes with its existing session cookie.
- Publish deployment-local `AGENTS.md`, OpenAPI 3.1, and Postman artifacts so people and AI agents
  can discover, inspect, and test each installation's API without an HQBase-specific SDK.
- Add OAuth Device Authorization for agents and command-line clients, including normal-browser
  approval, short-lived single-use codes, scoped access, and persistent D1-backed verification
  rate limits.
- Expand **Connect AI agent** to offer both the existing MCP connection and the deployment's
  `AGENTS.md` instructions, while keeping REST and MCP tokens isolated by audience.
- Add deterministic local D1 reset and seed commands for a ready-to-use development workspace.
- Improve Windows installation and release-script compatibility, protect temporary secret files,
  route Worker-owned paths ahead of the SPA fallback, and exercise the quality gate on Windows CI.

## 1.0.1

- Preserve invitation password setup links so `/set-password?token=...` reaches the password form
  instead of being normalized to the inbox.

## 1.0.0

- Publish HQBase as one free and open-source shared email workspace for customer-owned Cloudflare
  infrastructure, with one signed public release and update channel.
- Support multiple email domains, shared mailboxes, aliases, catch-all delivery, drafts,
  conversations, replies, forwarding, attachments, and Gmail-compatible quoted history.
- Enforce owner, admin, member, and mailbox-level read, agent, and manager access throughout the app
  and OAuth-protected MCP endpoints.
- Provide responsive desktop, mobile, and installable PWA experiences with mailbox filtering,
  notifications, offline handling, update readiness, and device-safe layouts.
- Keep setup, domain management, updates, backup, restore, diagnostics, and resource removal inside
  the customer Cloudflare account.
- Use the verified public Cloudflare OAuth client by default and support private customer-managed
  OAuth clients with Authorization Code and PKCE, without client secrets or pasted API tokens.
- Verify signed release manifests and artifact digests before deployment, with compatibility
  checks, D1 recovery bookmarks, Worker rollback details, and staging lifecycle coverage.
